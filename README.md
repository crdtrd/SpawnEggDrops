# SpawnEggDrops
## Summary
A server side fabric mod that makes it so mobs have a small very chance to drop their respective spawn eggs, affected by looting.
## Features
- Kill mobs, get their spawn.
- Gruesome yes but how else would it make sense to obtain spawn eggs in survival?
- What you do with them is up to you. May I suggest using them on a spawner? ;)
